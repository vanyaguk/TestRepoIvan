    <h1>JESUS</h1>
    <h2>A new beginning...</h2>
      <p>To be made whole, or to be saved, is to submit to God and His plan and purpose for our lives. <br>It is a turning from our old ways and turning to Jesus, to ask Him for forgiveness from our sins <br>and to give us new life in Him.</p>
      <p>Romans 10:9 says:
        “If you declare with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that <br>God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.”</p>
      <h2>Salvation is God’s free gift to us and we become His children.</h2>
        <p>It is an irrevocable acceptance into the family of God and it is an empowerment to <br>live life wholly and fully with the purpose of reflecting God to the rest of His creation.</p>
        <p>If you are not sure whether you are right with God or you know in fact that you need <br>Jesus in your life, you can choose to follow Him right now by praying a prayer of surrender to Jesus.</p>
         Dear Jesus, I’m praying this prayer because I know that I have done <br>wrong by living without You. I am sorry and I trust that You will <br>forgive me. I accept Your love and grace for me and ask that You would be my Lord.<br> Help me believe in You and love You every day, and help me <br>to show the world what You are like and how great Your love is. <br>In Jesus’ name, amen.

  <h1>Who Is Jesus?</h1>
The questions we like to ask about God are endless: “Is God real?” “Is what we know about Him really true?” and “What does He have to do with my life?” list just a few.

The Bible may not answer every question about God – and could even lead us to ask more – but one of the areas the Bible is quite definite is the answer to the question: who is Jesus?

Jesus commends the apostle Peter’s confession of Him as “the Messiah, the Son of the Living God” (Matthew 16:16), because Jesus knew that who He is – and could be to us – has the power to change our lives. Jesus is so unique because two worlds collide in him: heaven and earth, the divine and the human.
C.S. Lewis, a well-known Christian author, wrote of Jesus, “Either this man was, and is, the son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.”

Yes, Jesus’ name is the name above all names, and His star-breathing, storm-calming, miracle-working power is second to none. Yet, He is also the human Jesus, the personal friend who knows what we are going through and cares about us. That’s why the Bible also calls Him “Immanuel”, God with us.

   This is how much God loved the world: He gave His son so that no one need be destroyed; by believing in Him, anyone can have a whole and lasting life.
